# Decentralized Credit Union Toolkit (dcu-kit)

This repository contains the source code, diagrams, specifications for the dcu-toolkit.

The DCU toolkit is an infrastructure project designed to make community finance models primitive to the Cardano blockchain.

Through this toolkit, we provide a comprehensive, open-source set of smart contracts, SDKs, and APIs which enable developers to rapidly build decentralized credit unions with automated transparency, governance, and fund management.

## Overview

The Cardano ecosystem suffers from a critical infrastructure gap in terms of integrating co-operative finance, yet this is a financial model used in most emerging markets.

We seek to plug this gap through:

* Re-usable templates: Developers don't need to build core functionalities like rotating savings, governance, and treasury management from scratch because this leads to duplicated efforts, extended timelines and high costs.

* Specialised tools: There are no specialized SDKs or APIs designed specifically for co-operative financial logic.

* Trust & Transparency: Off-chain co-operative systems are prone to fraud, manual errors, and lack immediate, verifiable transparency.

## Features

* Self-Sovereign Group Management: Through NFTs and multi-party control, members control their groups and this eliminates the need for central intermediaries.

* Automated Rotating Funds: Our smart contracts automate sequential contribution, tracking, and distribution to eliminate manual processes and trust dependencies in traditional setups.

* Automated Loan Management: We include on-chain credit-scoring, collateral handling, and automated repayment tracking.

* Reusable Developer Infrastructure: Our comprehensive toolkit reduces the time to market for new solutions from months to weeks.

## Technology and Components

* Smart Contracts: Written in Aiken, they power the core logic for group formation, membership, fund distribution, and the treasury.

* Off-Chain SDK: Our TypeScript SDK with Lucid Evolution integration enables account abstraction, transaction building, and interaction with DCU smart contracts.

* Identity: Membership NFTS provide a standardized, portable identity system for group members.

## Roadmap and Milestones

1. Core Smart Contract Infrastructure (2 Months)

 > 20% Complete

Aiken contracts for group formation, member management, automated sequential fund distribution, and treasury operations with comprehensive unit tests and security validation.

2. Off-Chain SDK (4 Months)

A production-ready TypeScript SDK complete with documentation and test cases for all co-operative financial use cases.

3. Developer Sandbox (4 Months)

A web-based developer sandbox with documentation, tutorial guides, and full open-source release.
